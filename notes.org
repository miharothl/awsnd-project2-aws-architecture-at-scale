* Task 1: Create AWS Architecture Schematics

** Part 1

   Export your schematic as a PDF and save as Udacity_Diagram_1.pdf

** Part 2

   Export your schematic as a PDF and save as Udacity_Diagram_2.pdf

* Task 2: Calculate Infrastructure Costs

  Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate how much it will cost to run the services in your Part 1 diagram for one month.

  Target a monthly estimate between $8,000-$10,000.
  Be mindful of AWS regions when you are estimating costs.
  Export the estimate as a CSV file named Initial_Cost_Estimate.csv.

  - no redundancy (1 availability zone)
  - photo sharing only

  Return to the AWS Pricing Calculator and reconfigure your estimates for the following scenarios:

  Your budget has been reduced from $8,000-$10,000 to a maximum of $6,500. What services will you modify to meet this new budget? Export the updated costs in a CSV file named Reduced_Cost_Estimate.csv and write up a brief narrative of the changes you made in the CSV file below the cost estimate.

  - no redundancy (1 availability zone)
  - photo sharing only (reduced S3 storage by 1/3)
  - upfront web and application server payment
  - reduced RDB instance

  Your budget has been increased to $20,000. What resources will you add and why?
  Think about where to add redundancy and how to improve performance. Re-configure your estimate to a monthly invoice of $18K-20K. Export the updated costs to a CSV file named Increased_Cost Estimate.csv and write up a brief narrative of the changes you made in the CSV file below the cost estimate.

  https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=205c45a6ff82a1ac4d57edbd4feaa41c1e68e392

 - redundancy (2 availability zones)
 - increased S3 storage to support both photo and video (beta) sharing
